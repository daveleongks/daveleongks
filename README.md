ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Dave and I am passionate about connecting engineering with data insights and credit my analytical thinking for my love for LEGO. It taught me the importance of experimentation, taking calculated risks, and the joy of building new ideas from scratch.
These experiences installed in me a passion for problem-soving and a creative spirit that has guided my journey.

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning data analytics, machine learning and eager to share my learning in my github repositories.
